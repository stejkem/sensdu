# Sensdu

The project’s name is Sensdu that is shortcut for Latin phrase “sensum de sensu” (sense-for-sense). It translates words using Wikipedia page headers based on idea that the articles are written in different languages and they are connected between themselves. 

For example, you want to translate the Ukrainian concept «Домашній сир» into English. There is an article on Wikipedia in Ukrainian about this. At the same time, it’s connected to the article on this concept written by English speaking people. 
Thus, you have your translation and it’s not a word-for-word (or verbatim) but rather sense-for-sense translation.
